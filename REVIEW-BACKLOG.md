# Globe Deconstruction review — working backlog

Repo-root working file, **not** published (only `docs/` is served by Pages).
Tick items as pages land; keep the banked research notes with the item so
nothing has to be re-derived.

Catalogue source of truth is `docs/index.html`. When an item closes, update
**both** this file and the landing page's status chip.

**State as of 2026-08-17: 22 tracked items — 8 answered, 2 partial, 12 open.**

Ranking weights: how load-bearing the claim is to his thesis × how decisive an
answer we can actually make × public-facing (site) vs buried (book) × work
already banked.

## The queue

### 1. Equator Flight Data Challenge — `Q3 (p.46)` + `Section p.117`

- [ ] Page built
- [ ] Landing page updated (two entries close together)

He invites this one, it is his strongest genre (instrument data), and it has an
internal-contradiction kill.

Banked research — **do not re-derive**:

- His route: 8,250 mi / 119°. Those are *globe* distances used inside *flat*
  geometry. His own flat-earth equator is **39,072 mi** — a factor of π/2 too
  long. The numbers he uses and the map he uses are not the same map.
- Globe requires a **0.00°/hr** turn rate flying the equator; the flat model
  requires **5.16°/hr**. A flight data recorder distinguishes these trivially.
- On any other parallel the globe requires a turn rate of **tan(φ)** — which is
  why the equator case is the clean one and why he picked it.
- **Concession to lead with:** his attitude-indicator / pendulous-vanes analysis
  on p.119 is *correct*. Say so first and prominently.

Highest readiness on the board. Build this next.

### 2. Unknown Luminaries expansion — `Section p.153` + `Q5` + `Q6` + `Q7` + rest of `Claim #3`

- [ ] Q5 — stars vs planets show no apparent-speed difference (p.48)
- [ ] Q6 — Jupiter's moon shadows don't align to one light source (p.49)
- [ ] Q7 — full Moon evenly lit, no highlight point (p.50)
- [ ] Claim #3 remainder (moon lighting, moon-tilt illusion, Jupiter's moons)
- [ ] `p.153` upgraded from Partial to Answered

Highest leverage on the board: one page closes **five** catalogue entries,
including the outstanding two-thirds of a *public site* claim.

Notes:

- **Q5** is the weakest of his set — angular rate of the sky is set by Earth's
  rotation; distance does not enter. Short section.
- **Q6** is projection geometry plus ephemeris. Checkable, satisfying.
- **Q7 is the one to be careful with** — see Risk flags below.

### 3. Q8 — the Sun shrinks and fades rather than sets (p.51)

- [ ] Page built

Direct observational claim, camera-testable, and it plugs into the angular-size
machinery already built for Polaris in `docs/celestial-globes/`. If the Sun
receded it would shrink continuously and by a large factor all afternoon;
measured angular diameter is flat to well under a percent. "Shrink and fade" is
extinction and haze, plus the perceptual effect.

### 4. Section p.241 — All Construction Records Missing

- [ ] Page built

Blue-collar documentary evidence, which is where this project is strongest.
Candidate sources: long-span bridge tower separations (Verrazzano ~1⅝ in,
Humber, Akashi Kaikyō), canal and levelling surveys, the Channel Tunnel
gyrotheodolite work **already cited on the earth-rotation page**, long pipelines,
VLBI baselines, LIGO's 4 km arms following a chord rather than the geoid.

Caveat: it is a prove-a-negative challenge, so the page should be about what
*is* in the records rather than about the absence of anything.

### 5. Q12 — straight-line sunlight through the atmosphere / shadow angles (p.55)

- [ ] Page built

Cheapest win left. The plane-stratified Snell apparatus written for
`docs/celestial-globes/` §3 answers this almost verbatim: bench-measured n,
the exact `n·sin z = const` invariant, refraction ≈ 1 arcmin at 45° elevation,
and refraction measured terrestrially against tape-and-level targets with no
astronomy in it. Mostly an assembly job.

### 6. Q2 — has gravity been shown to override hydrostatics? (p.45)

- [ ] Page built

The "water finds its level" core. Real answer available — level *is* the
equipotential surface; the geoid; satellite gravimetry (GRACE); torsion
balances and gravimeters detecting local mass anomalies. Needs care not to read
as hand-waving; the strongest version is probably a working gravimeter survey
that finds a buried ore body, because that is a prediction with money on it.

### 7. Q4 — mirrored reflections over large still water as observer height rises (p.47)

- [ ] Page built

Narrower and optically fiddly. Overlaps the territory of
`docs/bottom-up-observations/`; check for reuse before starting.

### 8. Section p.203 — Extraordinary Evidence or Fallacy

- [ ] Page built

Different genre — epistemology, not arithmetic. Do it late, and concede the most.
**If he is arguing that the two models are held to asymmetric standards of
proof, that critique lands on this review too, and the page should say so
before it says anything else.**

### 9. Section p.415 — Antarctica's Magnetic North

- [ ] Page built

Well-documented, narrow, low stakes either way. Last.

---

## Risk flags

- **Q7 (full-Moon uniform brightness) is the one where his observation is
  genuinely real and counterintuitive.** A smooth Lambertian sphere *would*
  show limb darkening and the Moon flatly does not. The answer is the
  opposition surge and coherent backscatter off regolith, and it needs real
  photometry to do honestly rather than a wave at "the surface is rough." Highest
  chance of us getting something wrong — and also the best concession available
  in the whole remaining set.
- **p.203** — he may be partly right. See above.
- **Q4** — atmospheric and specular-reflection subtleties; easy to overclaim.

## Structure note

The 14 outstanding entries collapse into roughly **8 pages**, because item 1
merges two catalogue entries and item 2 merges five.

## Standing constraints

- Review stays **unlinked from the funwithscience.net main page** while the book
  is prerelease. Deliberate courtesy window.
- `celestial-globes/` is held back from Levi until he responds on the earlier
  material — it is the harshest page and the chapter is the least *him* thing in
  the book.
- Pushes go via the bundle procedure in `PUSH-README-globe-deconstruction.md`
  (working copy in the Cowork session; the sandbox git proxy blocks writes).
